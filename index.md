# Self Driving Car
In this project, I have built a self-driving car using an Arduino UNO and Sunfounder's IoT kit. The goal of the project is to create a small-scale autonomous vehicle that can navigate a predefined track without human intervention. The car is equipped with sensors and actuators to detect and respond to its environment, allowing it to follow the track, avoid obstacles, and make decisions on its own.

# First Milestone: Self-Driving Car Assembly and Basic Functionality
- Technical Progress:
In the first milestone, the focus was on assembling the car chassis and establishing basic functionality. The car chassis was assembled following the provided instructions, including mounting the motors, wheels, L298N module, IR obstacle avoidance modules, and the Line Track module. The Arduino UNO was also integrated into the car.
- Challenges and Future Milestones:
One of the challenges faced in the first milestone was ensuring proper alignment and attachment of the components to the chassis. This required careful following of the assembly instructions and attention to detail.
- In future milestones, the challenges to be addressed include:

        1. Wiring the components correctly and ensuring reliable connections.
        2. Writing code to control the car's movements, obstacle detection, and avoidance.
        3. Calibrating the sensors for accurate readings.
        4. Testing and fine-tuning the car's performance to achieve smooth and efficient self-driving capabilities.

- Plan to Complete the Project:
  To complete the project, the following steps will be taken in subsequent milestones:

        1. Wiring: Properly connect the components, including motors, sensors, and the Arduino UNO, ensuring correct power supply and signal connections.
        2. Coding: Write the necessary code to control the car's movements based on sensor inputs. This includes implementing obstacle detection and avoidance logic using the ultrasonic module and IR obstacle avoidance modules.
        3. Calibration and Testing: Calibrate the sensors to ensure accurate readings and test the car's functionality in different scenarios. Fine-tune the code and make any necessary adjustments to achieve optimal performance.
        4. Iterative Improvement: Continuously refine and improve the self-driving car's capabilities, incorporating feedback and addressing any issues or limitations encountered during testing.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
